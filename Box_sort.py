'''
Write a Box class whose init method takes three parameters and uses them to initialize the private length, width and height data members of a Box. It should also have a method named volume that returns the volume of the Box. It should have get methods named get_length, get_width, and get_height.

Write a separate function named box_sort (not part of the Box class) that uses insertion sort to sort a list of Boxes from greatest volume to least volume.
